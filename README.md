<h1>Seminar_On_Breast_Cancer_Prediction</h1>

<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
 
Breast cancer is the most common malignancy among women, accounting for nearly 1 in 3 cancers diagnosed among women in the United States, and it is the second leading cause of cancer death among women. Breast Cancer occurs as a result of abnormal growth of cells in the breast tissue, commonly referred to as a Tumor. A tumor does not mean cancer - tumors can be benign (not cancerous), pre-malignant (pre-cancerous), or malignant (cancerous). Tests such as MRI, mammogram, ultrasound, and biopsy are commonly used to diagnose breast cancer performed.

<h2>Expected outcome</h2>
Given breast cancer results from breast fine-needle aspiration (FNA) test (is a quick and simple procedure to perform, which removes some fluid or cells from a breast lesion or cyst (a lump, sore, or swelling) with a fine needle similar to a blood sample needle). Since this build a model that can classify a breast cancer tumor using two training classification:
<br>
1 = Malignant (Cancerous) - Present
<br>
0 = Benign (Not Cancerous) -Absent


<h2>Data Source</h2>
The Breast Cancer datasets is available as machine learning repository maintained by the University of California, Irvine. <br>The dataset contains 569 samples of malignant and benign tumor cells.
<br>I have used publicly available dataset Breast Cancer Wisconsin and downloaded from UCI Machine Learning Repository. <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29.">link</a>
<br>The data, in csv format, can be downloaded from this <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/breast-cancer-wisconsin/breast-cancer-wisconsin.data">link</a>
